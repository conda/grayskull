## Introduction

Grayskull is an automatic conda recipe generator. <br>
The main goal of this project is to generate concise recipes
for [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).
The Grayskull project was created with the intention to eventually replace `conda skeleton`. <br>
Presently Grayskull can generate recipes for Python packages available on PyPI and also those not published on PyPI but available as GitHub repositories.
Future versions of Grayskull will support recipe generation for packages of other repositories such as CRAN and Conan etc..

## Installation

It is possible to install this project using `pip`:
```bash
pip install grayskull
```

or `conda`, using the ``conda-forge`` channel:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge grayskull
```

It is also possible to clone this repo and install it using `pip`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/conda-incubator/grayskull.git
cd grayskull
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

It is pretty simple to use `grayskull`. Just call it, pass the repository
 (just `pypi` for now) and the package name.

* Example:
```bash
grayskull pypi pytest
```

After that `grayskull` will create a folder with the same name as the package
and inside this folder the generated recipe will be present (`meta.yaml`).

* Example with `pytest` (`grayskull pypi pytest`):

![Grayskull CLI](https://github.com/conda-incubator/grayskull/raw/main/images/cli_example_grayskull.gif)

If your package is a GitHub repository just replace the package name with the GitHub repository URL. <br>
For example: <br>

```bash
grayskull pypi https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python
```

You can also generate a recipe from a local sdist archive:

```bash
grayskull pypi ./pytest-5.3.5.tar.gz
```

Note that such a recipe isn't really portable as it will depend on the local path of the
sdist file. It can be useful if you want to automatically generate a conda package.

### Online Grayskull

It is also possible to use Grayskull without any installation. You can go to this website [marcelotrevisani.com/grayskull](https://www.marcelotrevisani.com/grayskull) and inform the name and the version (optional) of the package and it will create the recipe for you.
